				<p>Christian Flatshare reserves  the right, at any time, to charge or modify fees for access to the Site or for  any of its Services. Christian Flatshare will notify you of any such fees by  posting information regarding such fees on the Site. </p>
				<p>You are responsible for paying  any applicable fees and taxes and for all hardware, software, service and other  costs you may incur in connection with the Services, including costs incurred  in connecting to the Sites via the Internet. </p>

					<li> defames, abuses, harasses or threatens others;</li>
