                                    <p><strong>About  Christian Flatshare...</strong></p>
                                    <p>Christian Flatshare (CFS) is a non-profit organisation dedicated to helping accommodation seekers connect with the local church community: finding homes, growing churches and building communities. CFS gives all profits to charity. </p>
                                    <p>CFS wants to help the church to be, in accommodation terms, a welcoming place... <em>everyone</em> needs a place to stay.<p>
                                    <p>CFS helps  accommodation seekers to connect with the local church community, and for church fellowships to connect with those moving to their area. </p>
                                    <p>CFS is supported by the leadership of hundreds of churches nationwide. Church, Christian organisation and student group leaders can support CFS by allowing CFS to include them in CFS's Church Directory and to represent them on the accommodation maps with a link to their website.</p>
