    <span class="style9"> Below are some common sense pointers to observe when interacting with others online, which may help you to spot  unusual behaviour. </span></p>
<ul class="style9">
  <li><span class="style15"> Any  requests for payments through untraceable money trans</span>fer services such as &quot;<span class="style6">Western Union Money Transfer</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="style6">Moneygram</span>&quot; should be treated as  highly suspicious. </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.consumerdirect.gov.uk/watch_out/scams/cheque-overpayment/">Overpayments scams</a>: overpayments made with a request for the 'change' (sometimes blamed on a clerical error)  should be treated suspiciously. </li>
  <li>Be wary of       anyone who appears to want to remain distant from you, and does not wish       to see you or the accommodation before parting with  money.</li>
  <li>Do not  disclose your <span class="style6">banking information</span> to    individuals over the internet. </li>
  <li>Do not send images or <span class="style6">copies of identification</span>, such as your driving license or passport, which can be used for identity theft. </li>
  <li>Scammers often refrain from telephone contact as they are often outside the UK.</li>
  <li>Do not sign a contract or make a payment without <span class="style6">seeing the accommodation first</span>.   Protracted or seemingly awkward situations which make it difficult to see accommodation before paying a deposit or rent should be treated very cautiously. </li>
</ul>
<p class="style9">The <a href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/oft_at_work/consumer_initiatives/scams/">Office of Fair Trading</a> and the <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/sectors/infosec/infosecadvice/general/fraudsandscams/page33294.html">DTI</a> provide some helpful information on these matters.</p>
<p class="style9"><span style="margin-bottom: 0px">If your advert has ticked &quot;<strong><em>would prefer someone who if asked could provide a recommendation from a church</em></strong>&quot;, remember that you can always ask for such a church contact (website and email addresses) who can say that the responding  is known to them.</span> This is quite in the spirit of using CFS and you should expect such points of contact within churches to be offered willingly. If you do contact that church, those working in the church's office a very likely to be all to glad to help confirm that the person responding is known to them. </p>

<p><strong>About  Christian Flatshare...</strong></p>
<p>Christian Flatshare (CFS) is a non-profit organisation dedicated to helping accommodation seekers connect with the local church: finding homes, growing churches and building communities. CFS gives all profits to charity. </p>
<p>CFS wants to help the church to be, in accommodation terms, a welcoming place... <em>everyone</em> needs a place to stay. CFS wants tohelp  accommodation seekers to connect with the local church, and for church fellowships to connect with those moving to their area. </p>
<p>CFS is supported by the leadership of hundreds of churches nationwide, and seeks to be used and to serve the church with their support and under their authority. CFS is also supported by Christian organisations and student groups. </p>
<p>Church, Christian organisation and student group leaders can support CFS by allowing CFS to include them in the CFS Directory and to represent them on the accommodation maps with a link to their website. The CFS Directory helps to make CFS accountable to those who have and continue to allow CFS to list them. <br />
</p>
<p>CFS is  for accommodation for the whole church family:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Flat / House Share (a flat or house shared with others at a similar age or stage in  life)</li>
  <li> Family  Share (live with a family or a married couple)</li>
  <li> Whole  Place (an unoccupied flat or house)</li>
</ul>
<p>CFS features:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Post  wanted and offered adverts</li>
  <li> Automatic &ldquo;Flat-Match&rdquo; emails, to receive email with suitable accommodation matches </li>
  <li> Supports  over 25,000 locations in the UK  (cites, city-areas, towns, villages, tube stations)</li>
  <li> Search  results displayed on a map for easy viewing</li>
  <li> Records advert viewing statistics</li>
  <li>&quot;Pal-Up&quot; option to find someone to look for accommodation together with</li>
  <li> Secure  email correspondence through the site</li>
  <li>and  lots more cool stuff, plus some lovely graphics...</li>
</ul>
<p>CFS is currently free to use. If   members support us in 2008 we will introduce a small charge&nbsp;for   posting accommodation offered ads -   &pound;2 for Flatshare and&nbsp;Family Share, and &pound;10 for Whole Place ads. House / Flatshare and&nbsp;Family   Share&nbsp;will remain free for those who are unable to pay.</p>
<p>Charges (&pound;2 for   &quot;house/flat share&quot; /&quot;family share&quot; and &pound;10 for &quot;whole place&quot; adverts) are to help:</p>
<ul>
  <li> ensure the reliability of the offered accommodation adverts, by placing a small  commitment on the part of the advertiser</li>
  <li> contribute towards the running costs of our ministry (which are kept to a  minimum); all and any money raised beyond our costs will be given to charity at  the end of our financial year.</li>
</ul>
<p>CFS is an ecumenical church ministry. See website for details.</p>
