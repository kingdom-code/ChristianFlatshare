				<h1>Flat Finding Tips</h1>
				<h2>here are some flat finding tips from our international team of flat finding experts (ahem)...</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="two_column_canvas columnListMargins">
			<div class="col1">
			<ul>
				<li>Visiting a new place - why not take a friend along? A second opinion is often helpful, and it is usually safest to visit a new place in pairs.</li>
				<li>Have you met all the members of your potential new household? It would normally be wisest to meet everyone, so that you know who you would be living with and so that you can assess how well you would all get on.</li>
				<li>How could you bless your potential new flat mates? How could they bless you? What could you learn from them? How would you complement and encourage each other?</li>
				<li> Are there any household rules you should be aware of?</li>
				<li>Swimming pools &ndash; is diving allowed, and will you have any cleaning or lifeguarding responsibilities??</li>
				<li> How tidy is your potential new household? How tidy do you like to be?</li>
				<li>The term that the accommodation is available &ndash; make sure you understand the date when you could move in, and the length of time the accommodation is available, if there is a specified end date.</li>
				<li> How is food and cleaning done? Is cleaning done? Are there any habits for cooking and eating together?  Is there a chef??</li>
				<li>If the person offering accommodation has specified in the ad &ldquo;would suit someone who, if asked, could provide a recommendation from a church&hellip;&rdquo;, then it may be helpful to take the friendly initiative and to offer to provide any such recommendation.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="col2">
				<ul>
					<li>Do you understand all the Terms and Conditions in the tenancy agreement? What is the required notice period? What sort of agreement is it, joint liability or individual liability?</li>
					<li> Are there any regular uses of the flat? A weekly bible study? A weekly indoor football contest??</li>
					<li>Do you understand how and when rent should be paid? If a deposit is required, and when would it be returned to you?</li>
					<li>Budget and bills &ndash; what are your obligations to the regular household bills? Is Council tax and the TV license included? Writing a budget can be helpful.</li>
					<li> Smoke alarms &ndash; no place is a home without a smoke alarm. If there isn&rsquo;t one fitted we recommend that you make enquiries to have one installed. Smoke alarms cost as little as &pound;5 and are easy to install. Smoke alarms should be tested regularly.</li>
					<li>Security &ndash; is the accommodation suitably secure? Are there window and door locks?</li>
					<li>Location, location, location &ndash; how far is the accommodation from your friends, work place, college, your sports club, the gym, your church, public transport, a supermarket? the beach, the cinema (single-screen or multiplex??), a nice picnic spot or an appealing cake shop??</li>
					<li>Insurance &ndash; is there contents insurance and will it adequately cover your belongings?</li>
					<li class="mb0"> Prayer - we need to be spiritually tuned in for the big (and the small) decisions in life&hellip; prayer is the key to good guidance and for successful flat finding. </li>
